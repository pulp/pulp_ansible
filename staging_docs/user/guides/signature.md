# Signature Workflows

`pulp_ansible` supports Collection signing, syncing, and uploading. Collection signing adds extra
validation when installing Collections with `ansible-galaxy`. Check out the workflows below to see
how to add signature support.

## Setup

In order to verify signature validity on uploads you will need to store your trusted key on the
repositories `gpgkey` attribute.

!!! note
    You can upload signatures without supplying Pulp any key, but `pulp_ansible` will not
    perform validity checks on the uploaded signature. You will also have to configure the
    `ANSIBLE_SIGNATURE_REQUIRE_VERIFICATION` setting to `False`. By default and once a key is
    provided, all signatures impossible to verify are rejected.


In order to have `pulp_ansible` sign collections stored in your repositories you will need to set
up a signing service. First, create/import the key you intend to sign your collections with onto
your Pulp system. Second, create a signing script on your Pulp system with the parameters you want
on the generated signatures. Galaxy uses a signing script like the one below:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
FILE_PATH=$1
SIGNATURE_PATH="$1.asc"

# Create a detached signature
gpg --quiet --batch --homedir ~/.gnupg/ --detach-sign --local-user "${PULP_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT}" \
    --armor --output ${SIGNATURE_PATH} ${FILE_PATH}

# Check the exit status
STATUS=$?
if [[ ${STATUS} -eq 0 ]]; then
   echo {\"file\": \"${FILE_PATH}\", \"signature\": \"${SIGNATURE_PATH}\"}
else
   exit ${STATUS}
fi
```

Third, create the signing service using `pulpcore-manager`:

```bash
pulpcore-manager add-signing-service ansible-signing-service $SCRIPT_LOCATION $PUBKEY_FINGERPRINT
```

## Signing Collections

Sign collections stored in repository `foo` with the signing service `ansible-signing-service`:

```bash
pulp ansible repository sign --name foo --signing-service ansible-signing-service
```

By default it will sign everything in the repository, specify `--content-units` with a list of
specific collection hrefs you want to sign. Collections can have multiple signatures attached to
them in a repository as long as they are all from different keys.

## Syncing Signed Collections

Signature information will be present in the Galaxy APIs if your repository has signatures in it
and when syncing from a Galaxy repository, signatures will automatically be synced as well if
present. You can also specify to only sync Collections that have signatures with the
`signed_only` field on the remote. e.g.:

```bash
pulp ansible remote update --name foo --signed-only
# Sync task will only sync collections with signatures now
pulp ansible repository sync --name foo --remote foo
```

## Uploading Signed Collections

Signatures can also be manually created and uploaded to `pulp_ansible`.

```bash
pulp ansible content -t signature upload --file $SIGNATURE --collection $COLLECTION_HREF
```

Signatures can be verified upon upload by setting the `keyring` field on the repository to your
keyring location, and then specifying the `repository` option when uploading the signature.

```bash
pulp ansible repository update --name foo --keyring $KEYRING_FILE_LOCATION
# Validate signature against keyring of repository
pulp ansible content -t signature upload --file $SIGNATURE --collection $COLLECTION_HREF --repository foo
```

## Verifying Signatures with `ansible-galaxy`

Installing collections from `pulp_ansible` with signatures via `ansible-galaxy` requires
specifying the keyring to perform the validation upon install:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install $COLLECTION -s "$BASE_ADDR"pulp_ansible/galaxy/foo/api/ --keyring $KEYRING_FILE_LOCATION
```

You can also verify already installed collections with the verify command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection verify $COLLECTION -s "$BASE_ADDR"pulp_ansible/galaxy/foo/api/ --keyring $KEYRING_FILE_LOCATION
```
