# Welcome to Pulp Ansible's documentation!

Use `pulp_ansible` to create a private Galaxy. It doesn't have a UI currently, but using an API
you can:

- Mirror a subset of roles on-premise
- Mirror all of Galaxyâ€™s roles on-premise
- Store private Ansible roles on-premise
- Install Roles from pulp_ansible using the `ansible-galaxy` CLI
- Version Role content over time and rollback if necessary
- Support for the new multi-role content type from Galaxy

Issues are tracked [in Github](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_ansible/issues). You can file
a new issue or feature request [here](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_ansible/issues/new).
You can also ask questions in the #pulp-ansible channel on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!cbADstEIkixyOUTCtO:matrix.org?via=libera.chat&via=matrix.org).
